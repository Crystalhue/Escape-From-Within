# Escape-From-Within
This is my UTAR Year 3 Sem 3 Game Engine Prototpye Assignment source code, a click and drop of a psychological escape game.


Premise and idea
Escape from Within is a psychological, click and point escape room puzzle game where the player takes on the role of a person who awakens in a dark basement with no memory of how they are there. As they solve puzzles and explore the environment, players uncover their identity and the reason why they were stuck there.
Gameplay features
-Puzzle-driven gameplay that the players are required to interact with objects, solve the puzzles in each room as they progress through 4 different levels
-Story-driven exploration, with clues hidden throughout the levels to reveal the playerâ€™s backstory (Figure 1).
